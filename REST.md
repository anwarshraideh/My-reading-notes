# What is a REST API?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing decentralized systems. It originated from an architectural analysis of the Web and combines a client/server architecture with additional constraints that define a uniform interface.

Since an API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that lets programs converse interact (it defines the rules of communications between applications), REST as a style puts some constraints on what an API will look like.


# What are the possible technologies for REST?
Technology is the foundation of any REST APIs since REST is just an architectural style and therefore does not require any specific technology. But of course, the underlying technology of REST APIs must match the general constraints of REST, such as being a client/server protocol. Using well-known protocols makes it simpler to be easily usable by developers. Simple designs work best and mean that APIs can work easily with most programming languages.

The basic technologies used for REST APIs are HTTP, OAuth, JSON/XML, JWT, and Webhooks. These are the go-to and favored technology for API consumers—as well as providers—due to the effortlessness, safety, as well as the ability to make resources and data available. This makes it much easier to incorporate into web and mobile applications.

# How do they work?
A REST API works by breaking down an activity. This generates a sequence of small components, while each component will tackle a specific part of the activity. Flexibility is allotted from this component, but challenges can certainly arise.

REST APIs use prevailing HTTP procedures. They use GET to get back a resource; PUT to change the state of the API or modernize a resource. All API calls are stateless. This means that nothing can be held by the RESTful service between implementations.

# Why is REST API important?
REST API is the mainstay of service app development. It’s simple to use and has a global standard in the creation of APIs for Internet services. REST is any crossing point between structures using HTTP to get hold of data and produce operations on the data in all probable formats.

# REST API vs API
Rest API and an API may sound similar, but they are a different ball of wax. API is more the King of the world while REST API is the Queen. Two different categories! One is the top and one is second in command. An API is a general term, but a REST API is more specific.

APIs are the glue that connects one application to another with services and data getting access. The difference lies is that REST APIs are a web-service API or architectural style which utilizes HTTP protocol and JSON for data format. REST APIs bring about simplicity in development with limited resources and requires less protection.
