# How we can write a comment in javascript ?

You should write comments to explain what your code does.They help make your code easier to read and understand.
## comments kinds :

1. **MULTI-LINE comments**
starting with the /* characters and ending with the */ characters.

2. **SINGLE-LINE comments**

# How we can declaring a variable ?

to declare the variable we type and assign it a value:
var price = 5;


## **DATA TYPES** :

NUMERIC DATA TYPE 0.75 ------->  var length = 16; 
STRING DATA TYPE 'Hi'  ------->  var lastName = "Johnson";
BOOLEAN DATA TYPE true  ------->  var isStudent = true ;



### JavaScript Arrays

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value it stores a list of values. 
JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. Array items are separated by commas.

var colors; 
colors= ['white','black','custom'];

Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.


# Expressions 

Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value and evaluate into a single value  .
* there are two types of expressions:

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 

## switch

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.
• If a match is found, that code is run then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running (providing better performance than multiple if statements).

# headings

## HTML has six "levels" of headings:

< h1>This is a Main Heading< /h1 >
< h2>This is a Level 2 Heading< /h2>
< h3>This is a Level 3 Heading< /h3>
< h4>This is a Level 4 Heading< /h4>
< h5>This is a Level 5 Heading< /h5>
< h6>This is a Level 6 Heading< /h6>



- To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening < p> tag and closing < /p> tag.
  
- By enclosing words in the tags < b> and < /b> we can make characters appear bold.

- By enclosing words in the tags < i> and < /i> we can make characters appear italic.


- The < sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power .

- The < sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas .

- if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag < br />.

- To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the < hr /> tag

# semantic elements 

There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages — they are known as semantic markup.


- browsers will show the contents of a < strong> element in bold.
- browsers will show the contents of an < em> element in italic

- The < q > element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph
-If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the < abbr > element can be used. A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.


- The (<dfn>) element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term.
- The (<address>) element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.
- The (<ins>) element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while
- The (<del>) element can show text that has been deleted from it.
- The (<s>) element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).

***************************************************************************************************************

* CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

1. CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

- The < link > element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page 

< style > You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a < style > element, which usually sits inside the < head > element of the page. 

* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
