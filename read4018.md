# Access Control (ACL) 

# When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

- basic is string-based while the bearer is token-based, the bearer is more secure than basic since the tokens are encrypted

# What does the JSON Web Token package do?

is a standard used to create access tokens for an application. It works this way: the server generates a token that certifies the user identity, and sends it to the client.

# What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
should be kept protected, best kept in a .env file that is not uploaded with the rest of your code


# Vocabulary Terms

**encryption** : attempting to hide information/data

**token** : coded string used to securely transfer information over the web(between two parties).

**bearer** : is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens.

**secret** : this is what is paired with a token, a secret string stored on the server used to sign and encode the token

**JSON Web Token** : is used to send information that can be verified and trusted by means of a digital signature.

### 5 steps to simple role-based access control (RBAC)

RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in the organization
Alternatives/variations of RBAC:
- Access control lists (ACL): defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object such as a document .
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC): sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required

- RBAC implementation:
Inventory your systems
Analyze your workforce and create roles
Assign people to roles
Never make one-off changes
Audit
