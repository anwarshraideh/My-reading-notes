# HTML Description Lists

* The definition list is created with the < dl > element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
Inside the < dl > element you will usually see pairs of < dt > and < dd > elements.
The < dl > tag defines the description list, the < dt > tag defines the term (name), and the < dd > tag describes each term

* You can put a second list inside an < li > element to create a sublist or nested list.

# ARRAYS 

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

var colors = new Array('white ' ,'black','custom')
* to  Update the third item in the array
colors[2] = 'beige ' 

*************************************

Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 

## IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS  
if ... e 1 se statement allows you to provide two sets of code:

1. one set if the condition evaluates to true
2. another set if the condition is false 

* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands

* A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the
code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements. 
* A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array.
