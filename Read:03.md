# ARRAYS 

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 

## IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS  
if ... e 1 se statement allows you to provide two sets of code:

1. one set if the condition evaluates to true
2. another set if the condition is false 

Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the
code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements. 
A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array.
