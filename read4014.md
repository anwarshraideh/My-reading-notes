# Readings: Data Modeling


## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

- TDD reduces the time required for project development.
- improved design qualities in code
- Detailed project documentation.

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- Use beforeEach() if a method needs to be called before a test is run
- Use afterEach() if you need to reset the environment after a test has run

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development
not running tests frequently enough or writing too many tests at once

## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
ES6 Classes are more simpler and easy to maintained, inheritance is much more efficient than Constructor.

## Why REST?
Good for caching a lot of requests and Much easier to code/implement for web services than SOAP

# Term

- functional programming: programming style where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.
- OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism Related properties and methods can be grouped together
- Class is like a blueprint of objects that you want to create.
- super: this is used to call the constructor of the super (parent) class
- this: this refers to the current object being instantiated
- Test Driven Development (TDD): is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
- Jest, is JS testing framework.
- Continuous Integration (CI): consistent merging from multiple places into one multiple times a day
- REST: is an application programming interface, set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.
- Data Model, is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.

# SQL vs NoSQL:

- SQL databases are relational, NoSQL are non-relational.
- sql have predefined schema structured data
nosql are dynamic for unstructured data .
