# EJS  
EJS or Embedded Javascript Templating is a templating engine used by Node.js. Template engine helps to create an HTML template with minimal code. Also, it can inject data into HTML template at the client side and produce the final HTML. EJS is a simple templating language which is used to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It also helps to embed JavaScript to HTML pages. To begin with, using EJS as templating engine we need to install EJS using given command:

npm install ejs --save

* The default behavior of EJS is that it looks into the ‘views’ folder for the templates to render.

## Steps to run the program:

After creating all the files go to the root directory of your project folder.
Run command prompt in this directory.
Type node file_name.js command to run your program and see the output as displayed.

An EJS template typically contains mostly static elements that make up the structure of the page along with one or more dynamic elements. The dynamic elements will be filled in with data from an external source, like a database, at a later time when the user requests the webpage.

- For example, one EJS template could be used for multiple product webpages The template contains static elements for the page layout that make the appearance of the product pages similar. However, it also stores dynamic elements ("productname" and "productdescription" tags in this example) that will be filled in with the product name and description from a database when a user requests the page.

You can open EJS files with any text editor, since the files are saved in plain text format. However, you may want to use a source code editor that supports the language or allows you to install a plugin that supports the language to provide helpful coding features.

* NOTE: EJS is one of several JavaScript templating engines used by web developers, along with Pug (formerly Jade), Mustache, Handlebars, HAML, Vash, and Nunjucks.
