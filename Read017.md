# Readings: AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Describe “The Cloud” .
"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

- What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)? 
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another

- What is auto-scaling?
AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Using AWS Auto Scaling, it’s easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes. 

- What is bandwidth?
The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time.

## Vocabulary Terms

- Server Instances : An instance is a single copy of the software running on a single physical or virtual server. If you run two copies of the software on the same physical or virtual server, that counts as two instances. When you run two copies of the software on two different physical or virtual servers, that also counts as two instances

- Containers : A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another

- Cloud Services :  a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet, these services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware

- Cloud Architecture : the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network

- AWS : Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments on a metered pay-as-you-go basis

- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku : EC2/Beanstalk is an Infrastructure as a Service product (IaaS), while Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product


## Preparation Materials

### AWS S3 

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks using the AWS Management Console, which is a simple and intuitive web interface. S3 is the only object storage service that allows you to block public access to all of your objects at the bucket or the account level


### AWS Lambda
is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner. 

### CDN

Content Distribution Network (CDN) is now available to new and existing customers with all our hosting packages. CDN provides your websites with a performance boost wherever your users are in the world. With increased loading times that benefits your website with dynamic caching; providing full control over the duration of caching of images, Javascript and CSS.

A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos . When a user requests a webpage that is part of a content delivery network, the CDN will redirect the request from the originating site’s server to a server in the CDN that is closest to the user and deliver the cached content .
