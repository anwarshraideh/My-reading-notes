# Linked Lists

Linked list: data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list .
- The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.  

- There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. 
- Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
- Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
- Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
-  Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
- The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
- The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

One characteristic of linked lists is that they are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed

in order to get to the end of the list, we have to go through all of the items in the list in order, or sequentially

When an array is created, it needs a certain amount of memory. If we had 7 letters that we needed to store in an array, we would need 7 bytes of memory to represent that array. But, we’d need all of that memory in one contiguous block. That is to say, our computer would need to locate 7 bytes of memory that was free, one byte next to the another, all together, in one place.
On the other hand, when a linked list is born, it doesn’t need 7 bytes of memory all in one place. One byte could live somewhere, while the next byte could be stored in another place in memory altogether! Linked lists don’t need to take up a single block of memory; instead, the memory that they use can be scattered throughout.

- The fundamental difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures. A static data structure needs all of its resources to be allocated when the structure is created; this means that even if the structure was to grow or shrink in size and elements were to be added or removed, it still always needs a given size and amount of memory

-  a dynamic data structure can shrink and grow in memory. It doesn’t need a set amount of memory to be allocated in order to exist, and its size and shape can change, and the amount of memory it needs can change as well.

- Linked list is made up of series of nodes, starting point is the first node which is refered to as the head

- Head is effectively the only entry point to the list and all of its elements
- End of the list isn’t a node, but rather a node that point to null or an empty value
- Single node has two parts: data (information the node contains) and a reference to the next node
- Singly linked lists are the simplest type of list, based sonly on fact they go only in one direction
- Doubly linked list: when node can have reference to the subsequent neighbor node and the preceeding node too
- Circular linkeded list: has a node that acts as the tail of the list, and the node after the tail node is the beginning of the list

 Big O notation: way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm
There are two major points to consider when thinking about how an algorithm performs: how much time it requires at runtime given how much time and memory it needs
- Linked lists Big O equations O(1) and O(n) ,an O(1) function takes constant time ,an O(n) function is linear 
A linked list is usuallly efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but it can be very slow to search and find a single element
