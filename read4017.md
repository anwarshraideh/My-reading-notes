#  Bearer Authorization

# Write the following steps in the correct order

- Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
- Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
- Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
- Make a request to the third-party API endpoint
- Receive authorization code
- Make a request to the access token endpoint
- Receive access token 


# What can you do with an authorization code?
Authoriztion code can be used to set privilages to a user, or enter information or modify them.

# What can you do with an access token?
Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API.

# What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

Better security, token management provides you with a means of tracking each connected device that uses your API.also used to identify the users.

# Vocabulary Terms

- **Client ID** : Is used to identify the application. As per oAuth standard you need both Client ID & Client Secret along with user credentials to generate an access token.
- **Client Secret** : secret known only to the application and the authorization server
- **Authentication Endpoint**: The Authentication API enables you to manage all aspects of user identity when you use Auth0.
- **Access Token Endpoint**: where apps make a request to get an access token for a user
- **API Endpoint** : is a point at which an application program interface connects with the software program.
- **Authorization Code** :  temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token
- **Access Token** : is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread.

# Preparation Materials

JSON Web Token (JWT): is a JSON object encoded as a long string. We use them to identify users. It’s similar to a passport or driver’s license.

- When to use JSON web token:
authorization
information exchange

- JSON web token consists of three parts separated by dots: header, payload, signature
- JSON web tokens are a good choice to be passed in HTML and HTTP environments
