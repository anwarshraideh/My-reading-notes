# How to Solve Programming Problems

### A simple set of steps

* Read the problem completely twice.
* Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
* Optimize the manual steps.
* Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
* Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
* Optimize the real code.

## Read the problem completely twice
This is the single most important step.
You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.
You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else. If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it .

## Solve the problem manually
Programming is automation plain and simple.  You may have the ability to skip the manual steps and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.

It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.

## Optimize the manual solution
People often don’t realize how valuable this step is.  It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.

It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.

What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

## Write pseudo-code or comments
Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation.

If you are a beginner or struggle with these kinds of problems, I would go ahead and take the time to do this step anyway though.

What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job of filling in the actual code later trivial.

## Replace comments with real code
This step should be extremely easy at this point.  If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.

All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.

## Optimize the real code
Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.

This is also a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.  I cannot stress enough how important having good names for your variables and methods is for helping the person evaluating your code to understand what you were trying to do.  This is especially important when you make a mistake!

### Why is this important?
Problem solving is the meta-skill.

We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.

Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):

* Try a solution.
* If that doesn’t work, try another one.
* If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

# So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

* Understand
* Plan
* Divide
* Stuck?
