# Express REST API

# Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
- Authentication
- Error handling
- Data management

# Route Handler is Middleware

False, a route handler is the piece of code that makes an HTTP request, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

# In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
Middleware functions are not supposed to end the process. They use a method called next() which passes things off to the next middleware in the chain. Also, middleware in and of itself does not send data to the browser. However, when the browser (the client) makes a request to the server, the middleware will modify what the response data will look like.

# At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
After the request is made and before the response is sent, or it could be listed after the route being requested, but before the callback

# What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

- If you are calling a callback more than one time.
- Throwing an error after the response body was already formed
- This can happen after a response has already been sent, and you try to send another

# Terms and definition

- Middleware : function that process some data which is be called before the handler

- Request Object :Represents the information in the HTTP request from the client to the server.

- Response Object : The res object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.

- Application Middleware : Middleware that plays a role in the function of the application.
- Routing Middlewaren :Middleware that plays a role in path routing.

- TDD : Test Driven Development (TDD) is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.

- Behavioral Testing :  Behavioural Testing is a testing of the external behaviour of the program, also known as black box testing. It is usually a functional testing.

# Classes
Classes are a template for creating objects. contain a set of data and some method to deal with the data, and they are only available on ES6.

# Express Routing
Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

# Route Handler
You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like middleware to handle a request. you can have middleware function runs before the route handler

- Router is like a mini express application
- Doesn’t bring in views or settings
- Provides us with routing APIs like .use, .get, .params, and route
