# Singleton
A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance.

A single object used across systems remains constant and needs to be defined only once rather than many times

# Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

class PrivateSingleton {
 constructor() {
 this.message = 'I am an instance';
     }
 }
 class Singleton {
 constructor() {
 throw new Error('Use Singleton.getInstance()');
   }
   static getInstance() {
   if (!Singleton.instance) {
       Singleton.instance = new PrivateSingleton();
   }
   return Singleton.instance;
       }
     }
     module.exports = Singleton;


## If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
- Create a function that takes three arguments :
- req
- res
- next
- The req will indicate the data comming
- The res will indicate the data responding.
- and next will go to the next middleware.


# Vocabulary Terms

**Router Middleware** : means anything you put in the middle of one layer of the software and another. Express middleware are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server. Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route (or path) it's attached to.

**Dynamic Module Loading** :  the mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory

**Singleton Pattern** : A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance

**CRUD -> REST Method Matches** : create –> POST, read –> GET, update –> PUT/PATCH, delete –> DELETE

**Mock Testing** : is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules.

# Preparation Materials
- Passwords are the first line of defense against cyber criminals.
- Hashing is the greatest way for protecting passwords and considered to be pretty safe for ensuring the integrity of data or passwords
There are some weaknesses in cryptographic hash algorithm that allows an attacker to calculate the original value of hashed password:
Brute force attack: attack can simply keep trying different inputs
Hash collision attack: hash functions have infinite input length and a predefined output length, so there is inevitably going to be the possibility of two different inputs that produce the same output hash
BCrypt: algorithm that uses technique called key stretching, based on Blowfish symmetric block cipher aryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor (also known as security factor) which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be

- basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request.

- HTTP basic authentication (BA) is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages
- Since BA mechanism does not provide confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials, it is typically used in conjunction with HTTPS to provide confidentiality

- Server Side
When the server wants to user agent to authenticate itself towards the server, the server must respond appropriately to unathenticated requests (HTTP 401 Unauthorized status)
WWW-Authenticate field for basic authentication: WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="User Visible Realm"
Server may choose to include the charset parameter to indicate that the server expects the client to use UTF-8 for encoding (charset="UTF-8")

- Client Side

When the user agent wants to send authentication credentials to the server, it may use the Authorization field
Authorization field is constructed by:
Username and password combined with a single colon
Resulting string is encoded into an octet sequence
Resulting string is encoded using variant of Base64
Authorization method and a space is then prepended to the encoded string

- Bcrypt
Simply it’s a Node package to help you hash passwords in your app.
