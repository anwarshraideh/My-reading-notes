# What is SQL?
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

# Relational databases
Before learning the SQL syntax, it's important to have a model for what a relational database actually is. A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

In such a database, you might find additional related tables containing information such as a list of all registered drivers in the state, the types of driving licenses that can be granted, or even driving violations for each driver.

By learning SQL, the goal is to learn how to answer specific questions about this data, like "What types of vehicles are on the road have less than four wheels?", or "How many models of cars does Tesla produce?", to help us make better decisions down the road.

# SELECT queries 

o retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. It has a specific syntax though, which is what we are going to learn in the following exercises.

- Select query for a specific columns
( SELECT column, another_column, â€¦
FROM mytable;)

The result of this query will be a two-dimensional set of rows and columns, effectively a copy of the table, but only with the columns that we requested.

If we want to retrieve absolutely all the columns of data from a table, we can then use the asterisk (*) shorthand in place of listing all the column names individually.

- Select query for all columns
(SELECT * 
FROM mytable;)

This query, in particular, is really useful because it's a simple way to inspect a table by dumping all the data at once.
