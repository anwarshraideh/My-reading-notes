# image 

You can control the size of an image using ( **the width and height** ) properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box .

The **float** property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image .

- images are inline elements this means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block.


Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:
1: On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
2: On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

img {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
