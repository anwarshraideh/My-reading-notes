# Review, Research, and Discussion

- Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle .
 the request/response cycle is a useful guide to see how all the app’s files and folders fit together. The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren’t working).

- Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC .
A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server.


- What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
Deploying your application means putting it on a Web server so that it can be used either through the Internet or an intranet.


# Term

- Server : computer that provides data to other computers

- Pub/Sub : is an architectural design pattern that provides a framework for exchanging messages between publishers and subscribers.

- WRRC : The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers. Any computer making a request is a client and any computer sending a response is a server.

# Preparation Materials

- Virtual Machines : is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises).

- Virtualization: is software that manipulates hardware, while cloud computing refers to a service that results from that manipulation. You can't have cloud computing without virtualization.

- AWS: Cloud computing gives you access to servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the Internet. A cloud services provider such as Amazon Web Services, owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed


- Virtual machine manager: also called a hypervisor, type of software that allows us to run an operating system within another operating system (examples: VirtualBox, VMware)

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: easy to use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and Docker
