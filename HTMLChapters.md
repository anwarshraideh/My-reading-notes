HTML introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. 
The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
● A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.
The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
