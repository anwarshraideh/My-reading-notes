# HTML

## what is the html ?

The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets â€” these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: 

* an opening tag and (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) 
Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

* Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

# what is the wireframe ?

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
