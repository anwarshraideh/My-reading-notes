HTML

The HTML code  is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets â€” these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and(The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) 
Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

Everything inside this (body ) element is shown inside the main browser window.
 This (head)contains information about the page .You will usually find a (title) element inside it .
 The contents of the (title) element are either shown in thetop of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit . 
each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using .
If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these
characters: ( <!-- comment goes here -->)

Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element.

Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.Examples of block elements are
(h1, p, ul, and li).

Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as
inline element Examples of inline elements are (a, b, em, and img).

The (div) element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
The (span) element acts like an inline equivalent of the (div) element. 

The (meta) element lives inside the (head) element and contains information about that web page.

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them .

the (header) element used to contain the site name and the main navigation.
The (footer) element contains copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions. 

The ( nav )element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation .
The (article) element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

When the (aside) element is used inside an (<article) element, it should contain information that is related to the
article but not essential to its overall meaning .

When the (aside) element is used outside of an (article) element, it acts as a container for content that is related to
the entire page .

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

JavaScript

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
To write a script, you need to first .
state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 

JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.
When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML (script) element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.
Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.
