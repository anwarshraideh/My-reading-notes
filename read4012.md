## what is the difference between PUT and PATCH ?


The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.

**PUT** is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource.
**PATCH** is a method to apply a partial update to the resource.

## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server?
* Nock 
* Postman
* Mockserver

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
Swagger responses: ‘200’: description: OK ‘400’: description: Bad request. User ID must be an intand larger than 0. ‘401’: description: Authorization information is missininvalid. ‘404’: description: A user with the specified ID wasfound. ‘5XX’: description: Unexpected error.

APIDoc.js responce: 200: ok 400: bad request 404: not found 403: forbidden 500: server error

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol, It’s a messaging protocol for interchanging data in a decentralized and distributed environment, and it’s returned data in XML format. Mainly use for enterprise-level web services that require high security and complex transactions. APIs for financial services;

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It’s an architectural style that defines a set of recommendations for designing loosely coupled applications that use the HTTP protocol for data transmission. Mainly used for public APIs and it’s the most populat one.


### Term

- Web Server: A web server is a computer that runs websites. It’s a computer program that distributes web pages as they are requisitioned. The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. This intercommunication is done using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

- Express: it’s a node js framework, used for deveoloping backend web app and APIs

- Routes: is a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them. To put simply, in the Router you determine what should happen when a user visits a certain page.

- WRRC: The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app.




# TDD
“Test-driven development” refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing

It can be described by the following points:

* write a “single” unit test describing an aspect of the program 
* run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature
* write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass
* “refactor” the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria
* repeat, “accumulating” unit tests over time

# CI/CD
Continious Integration / Continious Doployment is a coding philosophy and set of practices that drive development teams to implement small changes and check in code to version control repositories frequently. It’s the best practice because it addresses the misalignment between developers who want to push changes frequently, with operations that want stable applications.
