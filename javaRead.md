An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value and there are two types of expressions. 
1.EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN AVALUE TO A VARIABLE
2.EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

Variables are used to store pieces of information used in the script. 
the data types numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
 
function myFunction() {
  var carName = "Volvo";
  
}

to calling the function myFunction();
